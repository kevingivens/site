![Photo]({attach}KG_BW_Pic_small.jpg)

Hi!  My name is Kevin Givens and welcome to my blog. I'm a quant living in New York City.  Before working in finance, I earned a PhD in High Energy Physics. This blog is a place for me to study and share topics I find interesting.  I hope you find them interesting as well.  They will inevitably be a reflection of my interests in mathematics and computer science.   

About the title of the website, it's a reference to the [Lyceum of Ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum_(Classical)).  This is the place where Aristotle founded the Peripetic school and lectured in philosophy.  Like an aspiring member of the school, I'm trying to sort out ideas by walking around a bit.         

As usual, the views and opinions expressed here are my own and are not a reflection of my former and current employers.
